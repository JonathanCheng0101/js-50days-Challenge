📘 JS/TS 50 Days Challenge
A personal 50-day challenge to master JavaScript and TypeScript through daily practical coding tasks.

✨ Why this challenge?
As a developer looking to solidify my JS/TS fundamentals, I created this challenge to:

Build hands-on fluency in both JavaScript and TypeScript

Learn by doing — small tasks, real-world inspired

Cover essential language features, patterns, and tooling that appear frequently in modern web development

🎯 What will this challenge cover?
Each day explores one or more practical topics such as:

✅ String manipulation (split, trim, replace, regex)

✅ Arrays and iteration methods (map, filter, reduce, etc.)

✅ Objects and nested data

✅ TypeScript basics (types, interfaces, generics)

✅ Utility functions and clean code practices

✅ DOM manipulation (later days)

✅ Modules, imports, and exports

✅ Type guards and narrowing

✅ Working with APIs and JSON

✅ Testing and code validation

✅ Modern JS features (optional chaining, nullish coalescing, destructuring)

Edit
Day_1/             # First day's challenge (e.g., string basics)
Day_2/             # Second day (e.g., sanitize user input)
note.md            # What I've learned and summaries
tsconfig.json      # TypeScript configuration
.gitattributes     # Normalize line endings across OS
Each folder contains:

.ts file(s) with the problem implementation

Optional *.test.ts or inline assertions

A README.md or comment at top for problem description

🛠 Tech Stack
TypeScript: For typing, tooling, and scalability

ts-node: To run .ts files directly during development

Node.js: Runtime environment for executing scripts

Git + GitHub: For version control and sharing progress

🧠 What I hope to gain
Deeper fluency with core JavaScript logic

Ability to write clean, typed, maintainable code

Real-world readiness for common dev tasks

Better debugging and testing habits

Confidence to use TypeScript in full-stack projects

📅 Progress
Day	Topic	Status
