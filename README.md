# ðŸ“˜ JS/TS 50 Days Challenge

A personal 50-day challenge to master **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** through daily practical coding tasks.

---

## âœ¨ Why this challenge?

As a developer looking to solidify my JS/TS fundamentals, I created this challenge to:

- Build hands-on fluency in both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Learn by doing â€” small tasks, real-world inspired
- Cover essential language features, patterns, and tooling that appear frequently in modern web development

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What will this challenge cover?

Each day explores one or more practical topics such as:

- âœ… String manipulation (`split`, `trim`, `replace`, `regex`)
- âœ… Arrays and iteration methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.)
- âœ… Objects and nested data
- âœ… TypeScript basics (types, interfaces, generics)
- âœ… Utility functions and clean code practices
- âœ… DOM manipulation (later days)
- âœ… Modules, imports, and exports
- âœ… Type guards and narrowing
- âœ… Working with APIs and JSON
- âœ… Testing and code validation
